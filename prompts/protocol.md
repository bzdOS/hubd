# How to work with this hub

Mechanics of hubd for agents. This is regenerated from the installed hubd version
into `HUBD.md` in the hub — do NOT hand-edit `HUBD.md`. Team rules (roles, project
policy) live in `AGENTS.md`, which is yours to write; this file is the tool's manual.

## Channels — pick the right one (this is the #1 mistake)

| you want to say | use | lives |
| --- | --- | --- |
| "I'm working on X — don't clobber" | `hub claim <proj> <area> <agent>` | transient, expires (TTL) |
| "this needs doing" | `hub task add "<text>" -p <proj>` | until closed |
| "this is now true / decided / learned / shipped" | `hub report` (below) | durable — journal + card |
| "agent, do this" | `hub queue send <role> "<text>" --from <you>` | until consumed |
| a trivial step ("starting", "looking", "still going") | NOTHING | — |

Report SUBSTANCE, never play-by-play. "I'm on it / in progress" is a **claim**, not a
report. A trivial step is **nothing**. Spamming the journal with progress is the failure
mode this table exists to prevent.

## Reporting — structured, at session end

File ONE `hub report` of prefix-tagged lines; each routes into the project card. Many
decisions/facts = many lines (one per line):

    hub report -p <proj> <<EOF
    DECIDE: <what> | <why>      # -> Decisions
    FACT:   <reusable fact>     # -> Facts & hypotheses
    HYPO:   <belief, unproven>  # -> Facts & hypotheses
    COMM:   <shipped / queued>  # -> Communication
    NEXT:   <the one next action>
    DONE:   <task-ids, comma-separated>   # closes tasks
    TASK:   <new task text>               # opens a task
    NOTE:   <one-line, anything else>
    EOF

- Do NOT list files/commits — "what changed" is read from git, not retyped.
- Lines with no prefix become a NOTE. A report that is ONLY a NOTE is usually
  coordination — use `hub claim` instead.
- Shortcuts: `hub decide "<what>" --why "<why>" -p <proj>`, `hub next "<...>" -p <proj>`.

## Cards & sections

One card per project at `projects/<slug>.md`: `## Digest` plus the sections reports
route into — Next step / Gates / Metrics / Market / Facts & hypotheses / Decisions /
Communication. Section headings localise (any language) in ONE file, `sections.json`;
see `hub sections`. `hub card <slug> -m "<digest>"` sets the digest; `hub get <slug>`
reads a project; `hub status` / `hub brief` orient you.

## Resources & the relationship graph

Infra is a card too, at `resources/<slug>.md` — host, vm, service, endpoint, provider —
with structured frontmatter (type/address/os/status) and typed `[[wikilink]]` edges
(`runs_on` / `depends_on` / `deploys_to` / `exposes` / `part_of`). `hub resource set`,
`hub resource list`, `hub resource get`, `hub graph`. Link a task to what it touches:
`hub task add "<text>" -p <proj> --resource <slug>`.

## Queues — addressed work

`hub queue send <role> "<text>" --from <you>` delivers work to a role; `hub queue wait
<role>` blocks until something arrives (exit 0 with the lines, or exit 2 on timeout).
One live waiter per role at a time.

## Session ritual

1. Read `AGENTS.md` (team constitution) + this `HUBD.md` (mechanics) + the top of `INBOX.md`.
2. Before touching a shared area, `hub claim` it.
3. At the end: ONE structured `hub report` (substance only — see Channels) + one INBOX
   handoff line for the humans.
